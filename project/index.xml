      <description>Introduction In a database of spatial objects, every tuple is associated with certain information represented by keywords. This paper introduces a new type of spatial keyword query, known as the m-closest keywords (mCK) query. The aim of the mCK query is to find tuples which are located in the closest spatial proximity that align with the user-entered keywords. In order to efficiently process mCK queries, a new index is introduced, known as the bR*-tree, which is an extension of the R * tree.</description>

      <description>Abstract In this paper, we cover various aspects of in-network data aggregation and processing in wireless sensor networks. We survey existing literature about energy efficiency, security, compression and query processing methods, looking at multiple existing research papers across these domains, identifying and highlighting key research objectives, methodologies and finally discuss how they build upon or improve previously existing solutions. Finally, we discuss future research goals in each of the areas.</description>

      <description>Crowdsourcing an Earthquake Early Warning System for the Indian Subcontinent (SNU-EEWS) Abstract: Earthquakes are potentially very destructive natural events. The risk from earthquakes is aggravated because they are unpredictable and can cause tremendous loss of life and property within seconds, particularly in dense urban settings. We present our ongoing work to develop a comprehensive earthquake early warning system (EEWS) for the Indian subcontinent. The impetus for this work comes from the fact that India has just 82 seismic stations for a land area of about 3.</description>

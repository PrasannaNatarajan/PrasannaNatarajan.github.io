[{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Crowdsourcing an Earthquake Early Warning System for the Indian Subcontinent (SNU-EEWS) Abstract: Earthquakes are potentially very destructive natural events. The risk from earthquakes is aggravated because they are unpredictable and can cause tremendous loss of life and property within seconds, particularly in dense urban settings. We present our ongoing work to develop a comprehensive earthquake early warning system (EEWS) for the Indian subcontinent. The impetus for this work comes from the fact that India has just 82 seismic stations for a land area of about 3.2 million sq. km, with no dedicated EEWS, plus low-cost accelerometers are now easily available, and smartphones have a deep penetration. The planned system will use a network of mobile smart phones and stationary low cost MEMS based strong motion sensors. The main components of this project are: creating a high-density network of low-cost sensors, real-time transmission of data, algorithms to analyze ground shaking data, compute ground motion characteristics, and determine if the source of shaking is an earthquake.\nThe proposed SNU - EEW system leverages many enabling technologies to satisfy the anticipated density and cost targets. It can broadly be seen as three different components:\n Ground motion data sources using low cost MEMS sensors .  Static – using stationary nodes Mobile – using smartphones  Algorithms for detecting P-waves \u0026amp; estimating earthquake features. A central server to poll the sensor network, calculate secondary earthquake features and broadcast warnings.  My Contribution: Designed the high level architecture of SNU EEWS. The architecture is shown below.\nBuilt the android application that reads the accelerometer readings and then:\n Plots the real time accelerometer readings. Streams the accelerometer readings to the server in the background. Receives alerts from server, if the server detects an earthquake.

Self-Service Portal for Mobile Application development (RMADP) Description: A rapid mobile application development platform where users can drag and drop components into a mobile screen on the portal and build a complete android/ios application.\nTechnology Stack: HTML, CSS, JS, Vue.js for View layer, which is hosted on an Apache server. STS server for controller layer. MySQL for model layer. Node.js and bash scripts for build server layer.\nDemo Video:\n \nPresentation: pdf\nReport: pdf\nTeam Members: Shourya Pratap Singh, Sneha Agarwal, Harshit Anand, Sneha Reddy\n2. IOYou - Debt Manager Description: An android application that could act as a debt manager.\nCourse: DBMS\nTechnology Stack: Android and SQLite for front end, PHP and MySQL for backend.\nPresentation: ppt\nRepo: IOYou\nTeam Members: Vedant Chakravarthy\nMy Contribution: Built and hosted the backend system. Made the SQLite connection in android. Also wrote the sync functionality.\n3. Symphonia - Sync your music Description: A synchronous music player for everyone. Music listeners encounter the problem that the volume of any individual device they own is often too low. Although the combined volume that can be obtained on all the devices available is adequate for their needs, this is under utilized due to a lack of the ability to play the music synchronously across all the devices.\nCourse: Software Engineering\nTechnology Stack: Android\nPresentation: pdf\nRepo: Symphonia\nTeam Members: Anirudh Badri, Hari Prasath, Vedant Chakravarthy\nMy Contribution: Made the basic music player in android. Worked on formulating a custom protocol for synchronized playing and implemented parts of it.\n4. Internet TV/radio - a collge wide multicast Description: An Internet TV/radio application that uses any source multicast (ASM). The first part of this project focuses on socket programming and the next part on making a GUI for the player. We used cvlc/ffplay for playing the received music and for GUI.\nCourse: Computer Networks\nTechnology Stack: C\nReport: pdf\nRepo: InternetRadio/TV\nTeam Members: Siddhart Mitra, Sridhar R Ramanujam, Vedant Chakravarthy\nMy Contribution: Worked on serializing and sending a multimedia stream.\n5. US-Pollution data analysis and visualization Description: A complete cleaning and visualization of us-pollution data.\nCourse: Data mining and warehousing\nTechnology Stack: R, Shiny\nReport: pdf\nRepo: US_Pollution_data_analysis\nData Source: https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/documents/data_mart_welcome.html\nDemo: live_demo\nTeam Members: Atish Majumdar, Vishal Gauba\nMy Contribution: Made functions in R to read cleaned data and visualize (choropleth, donut chart) the data. Also hosted the shiny app in shiny-apps.io.\n6. CatNap - Sleep Analyzer Description: This project lies in the domain of smart homes, as it monitors disturbances in light and sound while one is sleeping and provides relevant information. When sound increases, the system’s volume of white noise also increases aiding in one\u0026rsquo;s sleep as validated by many research communities. This works best with bluetooth earphones.\nCourse: Wireless Sensor Networks\nTechnology Stack: Arduino code (C++) for getting values from sensors and processing for GUI. Python for analyzing and plotting the received data.\nReport: pdf\nRepo: CatNap\nTeam Members: Atish Majumdar, Vedant Chakravarthy\nMy Contribution: Wrote arduino code for reading the sensor values (LDR and Sound Sensor). Wrote a python script for plotting the received data from sensors.\n7. SNU-Dashboard Description: An online portal where users can know all the happenings around Shiv Nadar University. Club activities to cab pool and lost and found all at this one place.\nTechnology Stack: HTML, CSS, jquery for front end. MongoDB as our database. Node.js for backend server.\nRepo:snudashboard\nDemo: link\nTeam Members: Hari Prasath, Vedant Chakravarthy, Vishal Gauba\nMy Contribution: Set up and hosted Mongo DB database instance for the forums.

This paper introduces a new type of spatial keyword query, known as the m-closest keywords (mCK) query. The aim of the mCK query is to find tuples which are located in the closest spatial proximity that align with the user-entered keywords. In order to efficiently process mCK queries, a new index is introduced, known as the bR*-tree, which is an extension of the R * tree. Following this, a priori based search approaches are used to decrease the total search space. There is extensive research being conducted on various forms of spatial queries, above and beyond the general one- nearest neighbour queries, range queries, and spatial joins. Keyword based queries have received significant attention in the research community. This paper presents a novel query, the m-closest keywords (mCK) query. An mCK query returns the closest tuples in any space which match certain keywords, given a set of m keywords as input. The main focus of the paper is to apply this mCK query in searching by document. A given tuple can be associated with as many as m keywords, hence the total number of responses that can be possibly returned from a mCK query is at most m. A problem which arises from this is that the value of m might become very large while searching by document, in which case the naive mCK query processing would become very computationally as well as temporally intensive, as the number of possibilities to examine all possible set of m tuples of objects matching the keywords would be needed. This process is extremely expensive and hence is not a good approach. This paper proposes to improve upon this by using a new index, known as the bR- tree, for processing queries. The bR- tree extends the R*-tree to efficiently summarize keywords and their spatial information. Following this, a-priori based search strategies are used to significantly reduce the search space. For application of said search strategies, some constraints are required to prune the dataset. The paper defines two such monotone constraints, the distance mutex and the keyword mutex. Finally, using all the above, the algorithm is tested and is found to be effective in reducing mCK query response time, but also provides scalability with regards to the number of keywords in the query.\nThe full paper can be found here.\n","date":1549664884,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1549664884,"objectID":"583625d5802c22264577ce3585c67845","permalink":"https://prasannanatarajan.github.io/project/keyword_search_in_spatial_databases/","publishdate":"2019-02-08T14:28:04-08:00","relpermalink":"/project/keyword_search_in_spatial_databases/","section":"project","summary":"Course work for Research Methods in Computing ","tags":["research","academic"],"title":"Keyword Search in Spatial Databases","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Abstract This goal of this paper is to do a literature review in the intersection of the fields of neural information transfer and information theory – Neural Coding and Information Theory.

The risk from earthquakes is aggravated because they are unpredictable and can cause tremendous loss of life and property within seconds, particularly in dense urban settings. We present our ongoing work to develop a comprehensive earthquake early warning system (EEWS) for the Indian subcontinent. The impetus for this work comes from the fact that India has just 82 seismic stations for a land area of about 3.2 million sq. km, with no dedicated EEWS, plus low-cost accelerometers are now easily available, and smartphones have a deep penetration. The planned system will use a network of mobile smart phones and stationary low cost MEMS based strong motion sensors. The main components of this project are: creating a high-density network of low-cost sensors, real-time transmission of data, algorithms to analyze ground shaking data, compute ground motion characteristics, and determine if the source of shaking is an earthquake.\nThe proposed SNU - EEW system leverages many enabling technologies to satisfy the anticipated density and cost targets. It can broadly be seen as three different components:\n Ground motion data sources using low cost MEMS sensors .  Static – using stationary nodes Mobile – using smartphones  Algorithms for detecting P-waves \u0026amp; estimating earthquake features. A central server to poll the sensor network, calculate secondary earthquake features and broadcast warnings.  My Contribution: Designed the high level architecture of SNU EEWS. The architecture is shown below.\nBuilt the android application that reads the accelerometer readings and then:\n Plots the real time accelerometer readings. Streams the accelerometer readings to the server in the background. Receives alerts from server, if the server detects an earthquake.
